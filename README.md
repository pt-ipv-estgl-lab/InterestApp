# Compute the amount of interest

 a simple program that will compute the amount of interest that is earned on $17,000 invested at an interest rate of 0.027 for one year. The interest and the value of the investment after one year are
 printed to standard output.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to `maintain sources`
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
